      <p>
        Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable database that makes it easier
        to track assets and record transactions in a corporate network. We want
        to digitalize the "Land Registry" procedure by fusing blockchain with
        workflow and document management. With a complete assurance that the
        information would be preserved in its original form, this will enable us
        to store and utilise information in a "distributed database." It will
        provide its users a "Portal-based solution." Users would include
        Respondent and Applicant. Users who wish to apply for the available land
        applications can log in using their credentials. The documents will be
        checked for authenticity by respondent users, who will also handle the
        applicant's demands. The entire distribution and application
        confirmation procedure would be safe and paperless.
      </p>
